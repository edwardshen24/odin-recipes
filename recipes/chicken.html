    <h1>Juicy Roasted Chicken</h1>
    <img src="../images/chicken.jpg" alt="Finished oysters">
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>My grandmother's recipe for roasted chicken. We are German and she used to do it this way all the time. I never have had a chicken this juicy before; this little trick works and makes the people eating it go silent. It's funny. We nibble on the celery after.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (3 pound) whole chicken, giblets removed  </li>
        <li>salt and black pepper to taste  </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon onion powder, or to taste   </li>
        <li>Â½ cup margarine, divided  </li>
        <li>1 stalk celery, leaves removed  </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Instructions:</h4>
    <ol>
       <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
       <li>Place chicken in a roasting pan, and season generously inside and out with salt and pepper. Sprinkle inside and out with onion powder. Place 3 tablespoons margarine in the chicken cavity. Arrange dollops of the remaining margarine around the chicken's exterior. Cut the celery into 3 or 4 pieces, and place in the chicken cavity.</li>
       <li>Bake uncovered 1 hour and 15 minutes in the preheated oven, to a minimum internal temperature of 180 degrees F (82 degrees C). Remove from heat, and baste with melted margarine and drippings. Cover with aluminum foil, and allow to rest about 30 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
